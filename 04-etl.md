## Data preparation (ETL)

So far, we have just run queries on the raw CSV-formatted data. This is far from optimal both from performance and cost perspectives. Using text formatted data forces the query interpreter to scan entire rows, even when only a few columns are needed. Non-compressed formats make the query engine scan a lot more bytes than it would have done otherwise. More data scanned means worse performance at a higher cost.

To help us in that area, we can leverage columnar formats, such as Parquet and ORC, that also allow for block compression.

In this section we will leverage [AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/) to create ETL jobs that will transform the original CSV-formatted data into [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/). In addition to that, we will aggregate the data from the three original tables into one target table only.

1. Navigate back to the [AWS Glue management console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/glue/home). Make sure the AWS Region selector matches the one you have been working with so far.

2. In the navigation pane on the left, click on **Jobs**. Click **Add job**

3. Specify job properties as follows:
	* Job name: `yellow2parquet`
	* IAM role: `DefaultAWSGlueServiceRole`
	* This job runs: *A proposed script generated by AWS Glue*
	* ETL language: *Python*
	* Script file name: `yellow2parquet`
	* S3 path where the script is stored: `s3://<workshop-bucket>/nyc-tlc-scripts`
	* Temporary directory: `s3://<workshop-bucket>/tmp`
	
	Click **Next**
 
	![Glue add job](images/12a-glue-add-job.png)

4. Select the `nyc-tlc.yellow` table as data source. Click **Next**
 
	![Glue add job](images/12b-glue-add-job.png)

5. As data target:
	* Select *Create tables in your data target*
	* Data store: Amazon S3
	* Format: Parquet
	* Target path: `s3://<workshop-bucket>/data/nyc-tlc-parquet/all`
	 
	Click **Next**

	![Glue add job](images/12c-glue-add-job.png)
	
6. Now specify how source columns map to target columns. First, get rid of the columns we do not want to be part of the transformed table by clicking the <img src=images/12d-glue-add-job-remove-icon.png width=10px> icon, leaving only the colums below:
	* `vendorid`
	* `tpep_pickup_datetime`
	* `tpep_dropoff_datetime`
	* `trip_distance`
	* `pulocationid`
	* `dolocationid`
	* `total_amount`
	 
	![Glue add job](images/12d-glue-add-job.png)

	Now click over the name of column `tpep_pickup_datetime` and change it to `pickup_datetime`

	![Glue add job](images/12e-glue-add-job.png)
	 
	Click over the type of column `pickup_datetime` and change it to be *TIMESTAMP*

	![Glue add job](images/12f-glue-add-job.png)

	With column `tpep_dropoff_datetime`, change its name to `dropoff_datetime` and the type to *TIMESTAMP*.  
	With column `vendorid` change its type to *STRING*
	
	Click **Save job and edit script**

7. On the Review page double check your inputs. That will generate the AWS Glue PySpark script.

	![Glue add job](images/12g-glue-add-job.png)

8. To illustrate how you can customize it, we are going to modify the generated PySpark script to add an extra column. The extra column is named `record_type` of type `string` and will serve as a qualifier that help us differentiate the different taxi rides in the target table. To achieve that we use an [AWS Glue PySpark Map transform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-api-crawler-pyspark-transforms-map.html).

	Locate the line that starts with `datasource0 = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_catalog`. Right below insert the following code snippet: 
	
	```python
	## @type: Map
	## @args: [f = addFields, transformation_ctx = "map1"]
	## @return: map1
	## @inputs: [frame = datasource0]
	def addFields(rec):
	  rec["record_type"] = "yellow"
	  return rec
	map1 = Map.apply(frame = datasource0, f = addFields, transformation_ctx = "map1")
	```
	
	Now find a block of 5 lines with the first one starting with `## @type: ApplyMapping`. Replace those 5 lines by the following code snippet:
	
	```python
	## @type: ApplyMapping
	## @args: [mapping = [("vendorid", "long", "vendorid", "string"), ("tpep_pickup_datetime", "string", "pickup_datetime", "timestamp"), ("tpep_dropoff_datetime", "string", "dropoff_datetime", "timestamp"), ("trip_distance", "double", "trip_distance", "double"), ("pulocationid", "long", "pulocationid", "long"), ("dolocationid", "long", "dolocationid", "long"), ("total_amount", "double", "total_amount", "double"), ("record_type", "string", "record_type", "string")], transformation_ctx = "applymapping1"]
	## @return: applymapping1
	## @inputs: [frame = map1]
	applymapping1 = ApplyMapping.apply(frame = map1, mappings = [("vendorid", "long", "vendorid", "string"), ("tpep_pickup_datetime", "string", "pickup_datetime", "timestamp"), ("tpep_dropoff_datetime", "string", "dropoff_datetime", "timestamp"), ("trip_distance", "double", "trip_distance", "double"), ("pulocationid", "long", "pulocationid", "long"), ("dolocationid", "long", "dolocationid", "long"), ("total_amount", "double", "total_amount", "double"), ("record_type", "string", "record_type", "string")], transformation_ctx = "applymapping1")
	```

	Click **Generate diagram** to make sure syntax is ok. Verify the ETL diagram changes accordingly.
	
9. Click **Save** and **Run job**. In the pop-up window click **Run job** again. The job is scheduled for execution and it will start running in a few seconds/minutes. When it starts, you can follow its progress on the **Logs** tab. It will take it somewhere close to 15 minutes to finish.

10. Wait for the job to finish. Close the script view and verify that the job ended successfully.

	![Glue run job](images/14-glue-succeeded-job.png)
	
	If it did not, you can access the job output and error logs by clicking on the **Logs** and **Errors logs** links
	
11. Create a new job for the `green` table as follows.

	* `trip_distance`
	* `pulocationid`
	* `dolocationid`
	* `total_amount`

	Locate the line that starts with `datasource0 = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_catalog`. Right below insert the following code snippet: 
	
	```python
	## @type: Map
	## @args: [f = addFields, transformation_ctx = "map1"]
	## @return: map1
	## @inputs: [frame = datasource0]
	def addFields(rec):
		rec["record_type"] = "green"
		return rec
	map1 = Map.apply(frame = datasource0, f = addFields, transformation_ctx = "map1")
	```
	
	Now find a block of 5 lines with the first one starting with `## @type: ApplyMapping`. Replace those 5 lines by the following code snippet:

	```python
	## @type: ApplyMapping
	## @args: [mapping = [("vendorid", "long", "vendorid", "string"), ("lpep_pickup_datetime", "string", "pickup_datetime", "timestamp"), ("lpep_dropoff_datetime", "string", "dropoff_datetime", "timestamp"), ("pulocationid", "long", "pulocationid", "long"), ("dolocationid", "long", "dolocationid", "long"), ("total_amount", "double", "total_amount", "double"), ("record_type", "string", "record_type", "string")], transformation_ctx = "applymapping1"]
	## @return: applymapping1
	## @inputs: [frame = map1]
	applymapping1 = ApplyMapping.apply(frame = map1, mappings = [("vendorid", "long", "vendorid", "string"), ("lpep_pickup_datetime", "string", "pickup_datetime", "timestamp"), ("lpep_dropoff_datetime", "string", "dropoff_datetime", "timestamp"), ("pulocationid", "long", "pulocationid", "long"), ("dolocationid", "long", "dolocationid", "long"), ("total_amount", "double", "total_amount", "double"), ("record_type", "string", "record_type", "string")], transformation_ctx = "applymapping1")
	```	
	
	Save and run the job. It will take it somewhere close to 10 minutes to finish.
	
12. Create a third job for the `fhv` table as follows.

	Job properties:
	
	* Job name: `fhv2parquet`
	* IAM role: `DefaultAWSGlueServiceRole`
	* This job runs: *A proposed script generated by AWS Glue*
	* ETL language: *Python*
	* Script file name: `fhv2parquet `
	* S3 path where the script is stored: `s3://<workshop-bucket>/nyc-tlc-scripts`
	* Temporary directory: `s3://<workshop-bucket>/tmp`  
	
	Data source:  
	
	* Table: `nyc-tlc.fhv`
	
	Data target:
	
	* Select *Create tables in your data target*
	* Data store: Amazon S3
	* Format: Parquet
	* Target path: `s3://<workshop-bucket>/data/nyc-tlc-parquet/all`
	 
	Mappings:
	
	* `dispatching_base_num`, to `vendorid`
	* `pickup_datetime`, as *TIMESTAMP*
	* `dropoff_datetime`, as *TIMESTAMP*
	* `pulocationid`
	* `dolocationid`

	Locate the line that starts with `datasource0 = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_catalog`. Right below insert the following code snippet: 
		
	```python
	## @type: Map
	## @args: [f = addFields, transformation_ctx = "map1"]
	## @return: map1
	## @inputs: [frame = datasource0]
	def addFields(rec):
		rec["record_type"] = "fhv"
		rec["total_amount"] = 0
		return rec
	map1 = Map.apply(frame = datasource0, f = addFields, transformation_ctx = "map1")
	```
	
	Now find a block of 5 lines with the first one starting with `## @type: ApplyMapping`. Replace those 5 lines by the following code snippet:
			
	```python
	## @type: ApplyMapping
	## @args: [mapping = [("dispatching_base_num", "string", "vendorid", "string"), ("pickup_datetime", "string", "pickup_datetime", "timestamp"), ("dropoff_datetime", "string", "dropoff_datetime", "timestamp"), ("pulocationid", "long", "pulocationid", "long"), ("dolocationid", "long", "dolocationid", "long"), ("total_amount", "double", "total_amount", "double"), ("record_type", "string", "record_type", "string")], transformation_ctx = "applymapping1"]
	## @return: applymapping1
	## @inputs: [frame = map1]
	applymapping1 = ApplyMapping.apply(frame = map1, mappings = [("dispatching_base_num", "string", "vendorid", "string"), ("pickup_datetime", "string", "pickup_datetime", "timestamp"), ("dropoff_datetime", "string", "dropoff_datetime", "timestamp"), ("pulocationid", "long", "pulocationid", "long"), ("dolocationid", "long", "dolocationid", "long"), ("total_amount", "double", "total_amount", "double"), ("record_type", "string", "record_type", "string")], transformation_ctx = "applymapping1")
	```	
	
	Save and run the job. It will take it somewhere close to 10 minutes to finish.

13. Verify you ended up with 3 succeessfully executed jobs.
	
14. Now that you have a Parquet-formatted object on S3, create a new crawler to catalog the table just created:

	* Name: `nyc-tlc-trip-record-data-parquet` 
	* Data store: S3
	* Crawl data in: *Specified path in my account*
	* Include path: `s3://<workshop-bucket>/data/nyc-tlc-parquet/all/`
	* IAM role: `DefaultAWSGlueServiceRole`
	* Frequency: *Run on demand*
	* Add database: `nyc-tlc-parquet`

	Run the crawler and see the new table in the catalog.

15. Explore the Parquet-based table on Amazon Athena. Verify the improvement in both performance and amount of data scanned compared to analogous queries run against the non-cormpressed CSV-based tables.
	
	**Parquet**
	
	```sql
	SELECT record_type, count(*) AS total_rides
	FROM "nyc-tlc-parquet"."all"
	GROUP BY record_type
	ORDER BY 1
	```
	![Athena parquet query](images/19-athena-parquet-heavy-query.png)

	**CSV**	
	
	```sql
   	SELECT 'green' as record_type, count(*) AS total_rides
   	FROM "nyc-tlc"."green"
   	UNION
   	SELECT 'yellow' as record_type, count(*) AS total_rides
   	FROM "nyc-tlc"."yellow"
   	UNION
   	SELECT 'fhv' as record_type, count(*) AS total_rides
   	FROM "nyc-tlc"."fhv"
	ORDER BY 1
	```
